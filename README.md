# Car-Rental

##About Project##

Moving on, this car rental project system project in PHP focuses mainly on dealing with customers regarding their car rental hours and certain transactions. Also, it displays all the available cars on the home page whereas the users cannot view unavailable cars until and unless the user returns the rental car. The project is divided into two categories: Customer Login and Employee Login. In an overview of this web app, the employee has full control of the system. Talking about the project, a customer can simply log in or register their accounts. He/she can view available cars, select any one and proceed for rental after selecting various conditions, dates, etc. After all, the customer can rent a car by filling up the given forms.

The customer can view all his rental records and history once after logging onto the system. In addition, the customer needs to return the cars using the system because all the records are carried throughout the system. At last, the system prints an invoice stating all the information with total costs.
